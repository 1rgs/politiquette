Politiquette is a Chrome extension addressing political, social, and economic inequality by displaying legislators' stances on disparity-related issues and allowing for shows of support or disapproval from citizens for those stances. It gets its information from expertly maintained political review sources and calculates composite interest alignment statistics alongside key positions on social and economic issues.   
Its usage is simple and involves no effort from the user- Politiquette works in the background while the user surfs the web, reads, news articles, social media, etc. It identifies and highlights instances of Senator names within bodies of text and allows a user to click on the highlighted name to get instant inequality-related policy context for the relevant senator. Politiquette is fast, smooth, and efficient, and was built to work with its own API endpoint.
